# INC Theory

## Introduction
INC Theory is a novel mathematical concept developed by Jotaro (นายธนกร เอ็นดู) in May 2025.
It defines a unique cycle of transformations on integers based on their remainder when divided by 3.

## inc_loop.py
This Python script demonstrates the INC cycle logic using the function `inc_loop`.
It classifies each step into three states:
- Rest (when n % 3 == 0)
- Expand (when n % 3 == 1)
- Contract (when n % 3 == 2)

Run the script to observe the cycle for an example number (7).

## Applications
The INC theory has potential applications in:
- Artificial Intelligence and advanced algorithmic logic
- Financial modeling and market analysis
- Philosophical frameworks on cyclic change and balance
- Industrial and organizational process innovation
- Artistic and creative expression through mathematical patterns
